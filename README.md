# ðŸ§© Pixel Art Work

**Pixel Art Work** is an interactive web application that allows users to upload an image and transform it into a pixelated version using a predefined set of 300 puzzle tiles. The tool generates a key that can be used to assemble the pixelated artwork using physical or printed tiles. Itâ€™s ideal for creating artistic puzzles, educational tools, or handmade mosaics.

Users can download the pixelated image, the solution key, and the individual tile cutoutsâ€”enabling a full offline puzzle experience.
